"""Human verification via a Telegram Mini App (join + moderation kinds).

Join flow (per-group policy):
- A new member passes ban-check + profile screening, then gets fully muted
  via restrict_chat_member. The group prompt carries a target-locked callback
  that redirects the affected member into the bot's private chat.
- /start in private chat sends a Mini App button (web_app); tapping it opens
  the challenge page inside Telegram — no visible URL, no browser jump.
- The page embeds the selected Turnstile or hCaptcha widget and submits its token together
  with Telegram's signed initData to the bot's built-in HTTP server
  (bot.services.verify_web). The server validates the widget token against
  the provider siteverify API and the initData signature against the bot token, so
  the verified user identity cannot be forged; no secret link tokens needed.
- Passing lifts the restriction (all-True permissions returns the user to a
  plain member governed by the chat's default permissions).
- Missing the deadline removes the user with a temporary
  ``banChatMember(revoke_messages=True)`` followed by ``unbanChatMember``, so
  they may rejoin and retry later while the Bot API revokes their old view.

Moderation-challenge flow (kind="moderation"):
- A message judged violating with LOW confidence under a ``ban`` rule is
  deleted, the sender is fully muted, and the same private-chat deep link +
  Mini App challenge is issued (begin_moderation_challenge).
- Passing restores permissions; missing the deadline bans the user in the
  current group until a group administrator lifts that ban.

Pending records live in join_verifications; a background sweeper enforces
deadlines even across bot restarts.
